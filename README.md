# House-Price-Prediction-Project
#Overview
This repository contains the code, dataset, and final predicted sales prices for a house prediction project. The aim of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.
Steps
Read Data: The dataset was read into the project, and each column was thoroughly understood to comprehend the features available.
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Various statistical and visualization techniques were employed to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of features, and identify patterns and correlations.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for model building.
Feature Selection: Feature selection techniques were applied to identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting house prices.
Model Building: Several machine learning models were built using different algorithms to predict house prices based on the selected features.
Evaluation: The performance of the models was evaluated using training and testing data to ensure their effectiveness in predicting house prices accurately.
Regularization (Ridge): Ridge regularization technique was employed to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the models.
Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross Validation: Hyperparameters of the models were tuned using cross-validation techniques to optimize their performance and prevent overfitting.
Prediction on Test Data: The final trained models were used to make predictions on the test dataset to estimate house prices.
CSV Submission: A CSV file was generated containing the predicted sales prices of houses, formatted similarly to a sample submission
